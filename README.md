# Getting started

https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/

## Installation

### 1. Clone this repo and enter!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vitto44/Motoroniq.git
cd Motoroniq
```

<br />

### 2. Install dependencies.

```bash
cd server
npm i   # to install dependencies for server
cd ..
cd client
npm i   # to install dependencies for client
```

<br />

### 3. In the server, you will need to create .env file and add PORT

```bash
PORT = port you want your server to run on, otherwise port will be 4444
```

<br />

### 4. From the server file run:

<br/>

Go to config/config.json and make sure that username and password match your local database.

<br/>

### 5. From the server file run:

```bash
node index.js
```

You should see the following message:

ðŸ¤– You good Boss! (â˜ž ï¾Ÿãƒ®ï¾Ÿ)â˜ž http://localhost:portnumber â˜œ(ï¾Ÿãƒ®ï¾Ÿ â˜œ)

<br />

### 6. Run the following command in order to populate database (database needs to be running)

```bash
npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all
```

<br />

### 7. Run both server and client (you will need two terminals open)

From server run:

```bash
node index.js   # I would suggest installing nodemon globally and do nodemon instead of node
```

From client run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

<br />

## Good to go! Visit http://localhost:3000 and you should be able to see the index page
